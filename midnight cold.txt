MIDNIGHT COLD!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Is it midninght?
who knows!
Wearing muffler, beanie
and hell lot of clothes.
Laying on bed
with a blocked nose.

Tuck in blanket,
waiting for sleep.
Cough, fever, cold,
arn't only things I feel.

Between this awake
a thought came of you.
My Heart skipped a beat
but I take this for you.

Night of suffer,
No one's to blame.
If cough is a shackle,
so love is a jail.
